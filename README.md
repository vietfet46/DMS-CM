# Dynamical Metasurface Aperture Simulation using CST-Matlab API (DMS-CM)
# Demonstrations
This code is used to automatically generate and simulate a dynamical metasurface aperture consisting of an array of randomly coded metamaterial radiator elements for multi- ON/OFF configurations of diodes. Then, S-parameters and nearfield scanning surfaces are recorded to analyze for the next required jobs.
# Requirements
You have to download and use CST-Matlab API from https://github.com/simos421/CST-MATLAB-API
